# semi-assembly-compiler
a semi assembly compiler - it takes assembly code and translate it to hexadecimal chart basically
the code goes through the assembly code and checks for typing errors and prompts them in the code run
the code builds a hexadecimal chart depending on the assembly code itself - if its an action code itll get a different hexadecimal representation than a instruction code etc.
in the code you have a test file where you can see the assembly code and when you run the code it will make new fille with a hexadecimal chart 
enjoy
